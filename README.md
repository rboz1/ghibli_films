## Overview

### Link to Site

[Active site link](https://rboz1.github.io/ghibli_films/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (Sass/SCSS)
- Flexbox
- React

### What I learned

This was my first **React** project so I wanted to make something simple to get the basics down but also fun. I love Ghibli films and found a pretty cool API to use!

I really like how all files and components are separated in **React**! I have a lot more to learn.

### Continued development

I'd like to build another simple app with **React** and want to give **React Router** a try too.

### Useful resources

- [Deploying a React App on Github Pages](https://techblog.geekyants.com/deploying-the-react-app-on-github-pages) - This helped me figure out how to host the React App on Github Pages.
